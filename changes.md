have to change the name of the 'order' and 'table' tables because they are SQL keywords
Had to add field menuID to use as PK because Name was also a keyword
AvaliableLate field not needed, all delivery not available after 9:00p.m.
Removed DeliveryPrice field because the webiste was too vague - instead charging $5 delivery and the order must be $40 or more
Added a description field for each menu item
